# Changelog

Versions are per-plugin. A version bump is what ships an update to installed
users; the CI version-bump guard enforces that plugin content changes carry one.

## session-memory

### 1.0.1 — 2026-06-12
- session-handoff: stale-handoff resume now explicitly declares the handoff too
  stale for step-by-step reconciliation and leads with a fresh start as the
  default recommendation (full reconciliation named only as the alternative).
- Eval suite: fixed a self-contradictory pasted-handoff case; harness captures
  tool calls so process expectations are graded on evidence.

### 1.0.0 — 2026-06-12
- Initial release: session-handoff + lessons-learned skills over the shared
  `.ai/memory/` contract, with the bundled SessionStart hook that surfaces
  parked handoffs and lesson counts at session start.
